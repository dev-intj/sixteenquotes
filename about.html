  <h1> About the project</h1>
  This project is just a random idea that I had, It's messages from myers briggs types
  that are gravitated to a point, It's about exploration of heart-felt messages/quotes/thoughts, to display that although we have different functions, we are not that different from each other.

  <h2> The developer behind the project</h2>
  <br/>Just a random dev, you can find some of my social media linked on the footer of the page.
