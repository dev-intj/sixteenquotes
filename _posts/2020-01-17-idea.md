# The birth of the idea.

I thought about a message sharing service, but didnâ€™t desire it to be only a static website. I wished to possess an excessive level of interaction to urge the user wanting to explore more. One of my favorite game mechanics is from no man's sky, and it's a exploring feature of planets.<br>
I thought about representing the messages as stars being drawn towards a center. And the planet consisting of the messages.
