# The birth of the idea.

I thought about a quote sharing service, but I didn't want it to be only a static website, I wanted it to have a level of interaction to make the user wanting to explore more. One of my favorite games is no man's sky, and it has a nice exploring feature based around the universe.<br>
I thought about making the messages being pulled around like stars to a planet. and the planet consisting of the messages.
