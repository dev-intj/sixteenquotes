# Development update.

Hello once again,<br>

I wanted this project to have very high perfomance on mobile devices and desktops/laptops. I am still aiming this project to be a website, but now I have some visibility problems and errors when I package the project for html5.<br>
But I won't let halt what I have in mind for the project. So moving on from that,<br>

<b>The next post will be a downloadable version of the project</b><br>

I have added a interface, I made a database system, and I started messing around with perfomance on windows 10. And, the first thing you will notice, is that I changed from the illustrators provided in 16personalities website, to shapes based on the color of 4 major functions.<br>

Analysts,Diplomats,Sentinels and Explorers.<br>

<b>I changed from using meshes, to billboards, a image that is rendered forwards the camera, that increased perfomance by a lot, thank you UE4 for that!</b>

# About the previous post

Bugs everywhere.<br>
Spent a lot of time on the interface in react but I had to scrap it all. The padding and margins don't work using the plugin, and I have no idea what causes that, half the time the interface is not even displaying, I tried to talk with the developers to come up with a fix, but the developers leave me on read.<br>
