# Hello world.

I have added a animation to explore the universe,

For now, the project is not connected to a database, and there's not a way to add a message to the database, but, the database has been made, and I am able to retrieve, and send information from it using the project. The foundation for the system exists, I just need some time and motivation to implement it.<br>

For now, I have to post-pone the project and come back with a fresh mind!<br>

The controls are these:

> MIDDLE MOUSE BUTTON allows the user to rotate around the planet.<br>

> RIGHT MOUSE CLICK allows the user to zoom in.<br>

> LEFT MOUSE CLICK allows the user to zoom out.<br>

> DRAGGING the mouse cursor on a message will display information from the demonstration database.

The download link can also be found on the home page!<br><br>
